Team 10 term project for CS 151-03.

Preconditions:
Java 8 is installed and is currently the topmost jdk in the user's system path enviromental variable (Windows).


How to run (Eclipse):
Import the project, locate Main, then run as Java Application.

.jar and .exe executable is currently WIP because we don't know what we should do regarding users with Java >=9 or users without Java.

Some information:
The savefile used by the application is named "lifetimeData.dat" and is autogenerated at where the project root folder is located on the first run. Deleting this file factory resets the application.
